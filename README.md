# Advanced Artificial Intelligence Starter Projects

These are projects intended as a starting point for the three key concepts covered in the module:

  * Goal-oriented action planning
  * Squad-based message-passing.
  * Chess strategy.

## Building

There are build solutions for both Windows (via MSVC) and Linux (via Zig).

Building on Windows is straight-forward, just launch a Visual Studio instance to open the solution file or invoke MSBuild from the command-line.

For building on Linux, install Zig `0.13.0` and run `zig build` to build all of the projects. A set of Visual Studio Code configuration files are provided for convenient task and debugging shortcuts out of the box.

## Art Assets

All raster art assets, with the exception of the chess solution, are sourced from Kenney's open game asset compendium.
